## App Description

A web application to keep track of digitial bookmarks (url links).  Bookmarks are stored in a database, and can be stored with a rating, description, and title.  The app does not have user authentication yet, so all bookmarks that are stored will be visible to the public.


## Screen-Shots


## Tech-Stack

The front-end of this app is built using HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery.  The styling is mobile-first, but is responsive to larger screen widths.  All of the front-end code is kept in the '/public' directory.

The back-end of this app is built using Node.js and Express.  The bookmark data is persisted in a SQL database hosted on ElephantSQL.  The server-side uses the Knex NPM package to query the database.
